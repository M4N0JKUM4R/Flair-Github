After installing the plugin, just use this shortcode: [github-flair] in your posts, pages or widgets.

You can make use of the user attribute of the shortcode like this:

[github-flair user="WordPress"] 
where WordPress can be replaced by your desired Github username.

By default, the search function is enabled but if you need to remove it, you can do so with:

[github-flair show-search="no"]
You can also make use of the shortcode in your template files using this

<?php echo do_shortcode("[github-flair user='WordPress']") ; ?
